# Buiness model canvas (BMC)

A business model canvas (BMC) is a strategic management template that gives a high-level overview of value propositions, customers, channels, resources, activities, partners, and more.


## Introduction

A business model canvas is a visual chart that describes a business's value proposition, customer relationships, distribution channels, target segments, partner collaborations, and the like.

A business model canvas helps stakeholders communicate, helps align activities, and helps show areas of trade-offs.

This page has our preferred business model canvas questions and ideas. This is based on our experiences with many software companies.
